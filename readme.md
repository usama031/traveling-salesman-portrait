# Traveling Salesman 

The **Traveling Salesman Portrait** project is a unique intersection of **optimization algorithms** and **creative data visualization**. It uses the classic **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** to generate portraits from image data by treating each pixel (or set of points) as a city that must be visited exactly once in an optimal tour.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To generate artistic portraits using solutions to the **Traveling Salesman Problem**, where each portrait is formed by plotting the optimal path through a set of points derived from an image (usually grayscale, thresholded).
